Trying out socket.io with node.js.

## How to use
1. You must have `node.js` installed to be able to use this application. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) if needed.
2. Use this command to get the required libraries (listed in the `package.json` file) : `npm install`. NPM is included with `node.js`.
3. Lauch the server locally using `node index.js` inside this project folder.
4. Connect in the browser to `localhost:3456`. You can fire up multiple tabs to test the app on your own.
5. Enjoy !

## TODO :
- add a reliable way to select all of the user's messages ( with data attribute ?)
- color change thing : use another selector
- general cleanup
- fix scroll to bottom breaks when scrolling up then down
- save messages in db
